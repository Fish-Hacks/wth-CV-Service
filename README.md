# Object Detection with YOLO and Flask

Welcome to our project, where we combine super-smart technology with user-friendly simplicity! ðŸš€

## What's This Project All About?

Imagine if your computer could look at a picture and tell you what's in it. That's exactly what this project does! It's like having a digital detective that spots objects in images. We use a special type of technology called YOLO (You Only Look Once) to do this. It's like magic â€“ it quickly figures out what's in a picture.

## How Does It Work?

Our project is like a friendly neighborhood detective that helps you understand pictures. You give it a picture, and it tells you if there's a cup, a laptop, a person, or even a chair in there! All you need to do is send the picture to our detective program through a special door we call "endpoints." You can either send the picture right into the door or package it nicely in a box (well, it's actually a JSON box) and then send it in.

## Cool Tech Stuff

We've used two cool technologies to make this happen:

1. **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** YOLO is a super-smart brain that can recognize all sorts of things in pictures â€“ like a brainy robot with superhero vision. It's like a "mind-reader" for images. We've trained it to be super sharp at spotting stuff.

2. **Flask:** Flask is like the friendly butler that answers the door and takes your picture to our detective. It's a way to talk to our program and get answers back. Just tell Flask you have a picture, and it'll get our detective on the case.

## How Can You Try It?

Here's how you can play detective too:

1. First, make sure you have the special things your computer needs (Python 3.x and maybe a fancy GPU if you have one).

2. Get the magic code from our project and put it on your computer.

3. Give our program a picture â€“ either by handing it directly to the detective or wrapping it up in a JSON package.

4. Our detective will check the picture and say, "Hey, there's a person and a chair in there!" It's like having X-ray vision for pictures!

## A Tip for the Techies

If you're a tech wizard and have a super-fast GPU, our detective will work even faster! It's like putting wings on a car â€“ everything becomes super speedy.

## Thank You!

We're really excited to share this project with you. It's like having a robot friend who knows what's in pictures. 
- Thanks to SUTD given us the chance to particiapte in this SUTD WTH hackathon.
- Thanks to the clever minds behind YOLO and Flask for making all of this possible.
